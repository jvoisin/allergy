# Allergy

Simple stupid photo gallery that is best defined by what it doesn't do and the features that is doesn't have:

- No database
- No comments support
- No user accounts
- No fancy and useless stuff
- No advanced security
- No metric fuckton of dependencies hell

Is uses old-style hipster technologies like Boostrap, JQuery and Twig,
mostly because I'm lazy and I don't know how to write a proper web application
with can-you-feel-the-razor bleeding-edge stuff like every cool kid.

If you want to use it, don't be an idiot: don't. If you still want
to use it anyway, at least shove it behind a reverse proxy with authentication.

(yes *allergy* is the anagram of *gallery*)
